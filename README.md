# MemeStealer9000
Saw a funny meme in a Discord server and wanna send it to your mates in another one? With one button press the Meme Stealer 9000 has you covered!

## Why?
My mate wanted something like this to make sending memes to our Discord server easier and thus the Meme Stealer 9000 was born.

## How to use?
Just click on the meme you want to send and press F12. Your screen should look something like this before pressing F12:

## Dependencies
### .ahk
+ Auto Hot Key (AHK)
### .exe
+ None

## .exe or .ahk?
+ If you don't have AHK v1.1 installed (or don't know if it's installed)
    + Download the .exe + OTA.exe
+ If you have AHK installed
    + Download either memeStealer9000 file + OTA file (memeStealer9000.ahk is recommended if you want to edit it yourself*)

*NOTE: Automatic updates will not be supported for .ahk versions

## Windows SmartScreen/Anti-virus intervention
This app is not verified by Microsoft thus SmartScreen picks it up. As for AVs, that's down to AHK itself, all AHK scripts are flagged. If either of these things make you feel too uncomfortable feel free to read over my code or use another AFK script/auto-clicker (or better yet, make your own!)
